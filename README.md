# 🎓 Interactive Lessons Hub

**Engaging, gamified lessons designed for students who've switched off.**

Traditional worksheets don't work for every learner. These lessons use **mission-based learning** — giving students a professional role, a purpose, and a reason to care.

## 🎯 The Approach

Every lesson follows the same formula:
- **You're not a student** — you're a consultant, reporter, engineer, or investigator
- **There's a problem to solve** — a government needs advice, a mystery needs solving
- **The content matters** — because someone is counting on your answer

Students earn **XP**, unlock **achievements**, and level up through **ranks** as they work. It feels like a game. It teaches like a lesson. It sticks like a memory.

## 💡 Philosophy

> "Disengagement isn't a reading problem or a writing problem — it's a relevance problem."

These lessons front-load the "why should I care?" before the content.
